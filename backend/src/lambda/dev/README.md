# Dev Lambda functions

The Lambda functions in this directory are just for development
purposes, e.g.:

* To populate the database with mocked-up stub data
* To get visibility into database tables which we wouldn't actually fully expose
* To manually kick off individual components of the OCR pipeline which will run automatically in the completed system

These functions would not actually be exposed in the public
API in a production deployment.
