This is a very quick frontend to demonstrate some of the backend
functions.  Start it the usual way:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

I created the frontend by modifying the code for the Todo app
frontend.

I haven't actually studied React, so this is a total hack job.
For example, I didn't clean up the parts of the Todo code which
are no longer being used.
